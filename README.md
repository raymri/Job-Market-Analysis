# Job-Market-Analysis
This project explores the Data Analyst job market in India using real-world job posting data. It analyzes salary trends, skill demand, and technology relevance, helping job seekers understand what skills are most valued ‚Äî and how they influence pay.

# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# Background- Key Questions
With the rapid growth of data-driven decision-making across industries, the demand for skilled Data Analysts has surged.
However, salary expectations and skill requirements vary widely depending on tools, experience, and company type.
This project dives deep into those patterns, aiming to answer key questions such as:

1. What are the high demand jobs in Indian market?
2. Which tools and technologies are most in-demand for Data Analyst roles?
3. How do salaries fluctuate month-to-month?
4. Which skills provide the best return on learning investment?
5. Most hiring companies in India?
6. Salary distribution of Data jobs in India
   

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Analysis
  **1. Data Preparation**
  I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```
  Filtered dataset for Data Analyst roles in India.

  Cleaned and standardized salary data to ensure consistency.

  Created additional columns for monthly trends and skill percentages.
